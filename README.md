## Credit

The Lucario color scheme was [created by Raphael Amorim](https://github.com/raphamorim/lucario). It's available for a bunch of editors including Atom, Vim and Sublime Text.

The scripts to write a color theme in YAML (VSCode likes it JSON) are adapted from [the Dracula theme's](https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code).
