VS Code port of [Raphael Amorim's Lucario theme](https://github.com/raphamorim/lucario). A darkish syntax theme for the 80% use case.

Selling points:

- a dark-ish theme that prevents eye strain while providing enough contrast for a well-lit room
- committed to provide good syntax highlighting for many languages (not just Python and JavaScript ðŸ™Š)
- inspired by [this beautiful creature](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Lucario_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#firstHeading) ![Lucario menusprite](./assets/lucario-menusprite.png)

## Installation

Launch VS Code Quick Open (`Ctrl+P`), paste the following command and press enter.

```txt
ext install victor-gp.lucario-theme
```

## Credit

The Lucario color scheme was [created by Raphael Amorim](https://github.com/raphamorim/lucario). It's available for a bunch of editors including Atom, Vim and Sublime Text.

VS Code takes JSON color themes. The scripts to make YAML work are adapted from [the Dracula theme](https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code).

Some of the code samples used for testing come from other projects. They are attributed in [this document](./samples/_attribution.md).

The theme logo on the VS Code Marketplace is a Lucario sprite from PokÃ©mon CafÃ© Mix. The animated Lucario on the Readme is a menusprite from the Gen IV games.
