# Lucario VSCode Theme

VSCode port of [Raphael Amorim's Lucario theme](https://github.com/raphamorim/lucario). A darkish syntax theme for the 80% use case.

## Installation

```txt
ext install victor-gp.lucario-vscode-theme
```

## Credit

The Lucario color scheme was [created by Raphael Amorim](https://github.com/raphamorim/lucario). It's available for a bunch of editors including Atom, Vim and Sublime Text.

The scripts to write a color theme in YAML (VSCode likes it JSON) are adapted from [the Dracula theme's](https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code).

Some of the code samples used for testing come from other projects. They are attributed in [this document](.samples/attribution.md).

The theme logo on the VSCode Marketplace is a Lucario sprite from Pokémon Café Mix.
